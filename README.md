# wr-event-chest
This is a War Robots simulator CLI (command line interface) program that simulates opening gold and super chests in the War Robots (3 year anniversary) event. 
(Bronze and Silver chests are not included because the prizes are not interesting enough.)

**Disclaimer:** It is just for fun, and in no way intended to be accurate.
The results you get in the simulator game cannot be guaranteed to be what you may see in the real game.

The drop rates came from an online forum, and there is no way of knowing if they are accurate, as this information is closed source and owned by Pixonic.

This program is **not** affiliated with Pixonic in any way, shape, or form.
